### Background

[Not In My Country](https://www.notinmycountry.org/) (NIMC) is a website that allows students in Uganda and Kenya to report instances of corruption from university staff.

[DataKind DC](http://www.datakind.org/howitworks/datachapters/datakind-dc/) (DKDC) volunteers are teaming up to expand NIMC's scope to other countries and public officials in different sectors (e.g., judges).

### Repository

On DKDC's DataJam on March 16, 2015, volunteers split into two groups.

* Searchers browsed the web to identify publicly-available data about public officials in target countries. A document describing the findings and, if possible, the data themselves, will be stored in the [searchers](https://github.com/jm-contreras/not-in-my-country/tree/master/searchers) directory.

* Scrapers will write code to scrape and/or format the data found by searchers. Their code, including appropriate documentation, will be stored in the [scrapers](https://github.com/jm-contreras/not-in-my-country/tree/master/scrapers) directory.
