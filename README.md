### Background

[Not In My Country](https://www.notinmycountry.org/) (NIMC) is a website that allows students in Uganda and Kenya to report instances of corruption from university staff.

[DataKind DC](http://www.datakind.org/howitworks/datachapters/datakind-dc/) (DKDC) volunteers are teaming up to expand NIMC's scope to other countries and public officials in different sectors (e.g., judges).

### Repository

On DKDC's DataJam on March 16, 2015, volunteers were split into 2 groups.

* Searchers identified online open data about public officials in target countries. A [Hackpad document](https://hackpad.com/Not-In-My-Country-httpswww.notinmycountry.org-RrVYW0iowGI) lists the sources identified and categorizes them by country and best method to mine them (manual entry vs. scraping).

* Scrapers wrote initial code to scrape and/or format the data found by searchers. Their code, including appropriate documentation, is stored in the [scrapers](https://github.com/jm-contreras/not-in-my-country/tree/master/scrapers) directory.
