### Background

[Not In My Country](https://www.notinmycountry.org/) (NIMC) is a website that allows students in Uganda and Kenya to report instances of corruption from university staff.

[DataKind DC](http://www.datakind.org/howitworks/datachapters/datakind-dc/) volunteers are teaming up to expand NIMC's scope to other countries and public officials in different sectors (e.g., judges).

### Repository

This repository is a collection of both.
